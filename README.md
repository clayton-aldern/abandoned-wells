# Waves of Abandonment
## The Permian Basin is ground zero for a billion-dollar surge of zombie oil wells.
This repository contains data and code to accompany the Grist and Texas Observer [investigation](https://grist.org/abandoned-oil-gas-wells-permian-texas-new-mexico/) into abandoned oil and gas wells in the Permian Basin. A further methodological brief and interactive app to explore the model can be found [here](https://grist.org/energy/scale-of-texas-new-mexico-abandoned-oil-wells/). The piece was reported by [Naveena Sadasivam](https://twitter.com/NaveenaSivam) of Grist and [Christopher Collins](https://twitter.com/collins_reports) of the Texas Observer. [Clayton Aldern](https://twitter.com/compatibilism) of Grist authored this repository.

Two datasets exceed the size limit of GitHub's standard file-storage policy and must be downloaded separately. (Note that for this reason, these files appear in the `.gitignore` file.) They are:  
1. [This dataset](), called `OG_LEASE_CYCLE_DATA_TABLE.dsv`, which should be placed in `data/TX/lease/PDQ/`, and
2. [This dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/106dUPDX-qYZu1oDksbRXpIg6l19uszxc/view?usp=sharing), called `ic.csv`, which should be placed in `data/TX/well/`.
